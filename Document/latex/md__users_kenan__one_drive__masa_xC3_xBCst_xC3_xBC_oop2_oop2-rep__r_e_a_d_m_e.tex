Use these steps to clone from Source\+Tree, our client for using the repository command-\/line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don\textquotesingle{}t yet have Source\+Tree, \href{https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/}{\texttt{ download and install first}}. If you prefer to clone from the command line, see \href{https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ}{\texttt{ Clone a repository}}.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item You’ll see the clone button under the {\bfseries{Source}} heading. Click that button.
\item Now click {\bfseries{Check out in Source\+Tree}}. You may need to create a Source\+Tree account or log in.
\item When you see the {\bfseries{Clone New}} dialog in Source\+Tree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click {\bfseries{Clone}}.
\item Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Now that you\textquotesingle{}re more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can \href{https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg}{\texttt{ push your change back to Bitbucket with Source\+Tree}}, or you can \href{https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ}{\texttt{ add, commit,}} and \href{https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ}{\texttt{ push from the command line}}.
